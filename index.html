  <p>But we’ve met before. That was a <em>long time ago,</em> I was a kid at St. Swithin’s, used to be funded by <strong>the Wayne Foundation.</strong>  It’s an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a <a href="#"> accident.</a> I don’t remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can’t do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy’s home, I figured it out too late. </p>

Bruce Wayne, <strong> billionaire orphan?</strong> We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that’s all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I’d seen that look on your face before. It’s the same one I taught myself. I don’t why you took the fault for Dent’s murder but I’m still a believer in the <a href="#">Batman.</a> Even if you’re not…</p>
